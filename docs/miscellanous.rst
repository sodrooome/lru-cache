Why use object cache level instead of filtering method or get method based on API? Ideally, cache is fast. and just fast as storage, reading or accessing the data from a cache takes less time than reading the data from something else. in example if you use filtering methods, you are doing accessing and getting the object from your database. Otherwise, caching the object improves performance by keeping recent or most used data in memory locations rather we're going to use computationally object from database.
